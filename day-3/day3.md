```
SymbolUse Case	Bool	Operation
5 < 3	       False	Less Than
5 > 3	        True	Greater Than
3 <= 3	        True	Less Than or Equal To
3 >= 5	        False	Greater Than or Equal To
3 == 5	        False	Equal To
3 != 5	        True	Not Equal To

Logical Use	        Bool	Operation
5 < 3 and 5 == 5	False	and - Evaluates if all provided statements are True
5 < 3 or 5 == 5	    True	or - Evaluates if at least one of many statements is True
not 5 < 3	        True	not - Flips the Bool Value
