# Day 2

## Changing Variable Values

Changing the variable value does not chage the the variable which was the fuction of that varible
because when a variable is assigned, it is assigned to the value of the expression on the right-hand-side, not to the expression itself.

```
carrots = 24

rabbits = 8

crs_per_rab = carrots/rabbits

rabbits = 12

print(crs_per_rab)
```
